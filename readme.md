## What is it?
This repo contains the configuration for `gitconfig` which can be used to setup multiple version control acccounts (specifically  git) on the same computer

for ex.
~/personal -> all the repos here can be from your personal github account
~/work -> all the repos here can be from your work github account
~/youtube -> maybe only youtube account  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Why is this?
To use same computer with multiple github accounts without mixing them with each other (pulls will go to the same only)

## How to use this repo?

put `parent-config/.gitconfig` file in ~/. location of your mac/linux (don't know if works with windows or not) 



# Clone
While cloning for personal account use personal.github.com (as the repo URL). You can change this Hostname to your liking in `ssh/.config`
